# WEEK 1 Overview
1. Overview of Network
   
    1. What is Network and its useage ? 
   
        * Network is a **collection of devices** capable of **transmitting data** including terminal devices and systems (such as users, servers) that are connected to each other to be able to communicate and transmit data. In a network system can transport many different types of data, data types and applications (such as video, image,...).
        
        * Networks devices: 
            * End to end users' devieces
            * Connectors
            * Netword interface card **NIC**
              * Switch, hub, brigde: Gather data form end-users
              * Router: find optimal path
        
        * Network parameters:
          * Speed : transmittion speed *bps* ( bit per second )
          * Cost: the cost to build, setup and maintain the system
          * Security : tha data must be protected
          * Availability : available to access anytime
          * Reliability : low packet-loss-rate
          * Topology : A network diagram that shows administrators how devices are connected in a system and how data flows in the system.

    2. Distinguish among **PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN**
       
       1. **LAN** (local area network). It is a group of network devices that allow communication between various connected devices. Private ownership has control over the local area network rather than the public. LAN has a short propagation delay than MAN as well as WAN. It covers the smallest area such as colleges, schools, hospitals, and so on.
       
       2. **MAN** (metropolitan area network). It covers the largest area than LAN such as small towns, cities, etc. MAN connects two or more computers that reside within the same or completely different cities. MAN is expensive and should or might not be owned by one organization.
       
       3. **WAN** (wide area network). It covers a large area than LAN as well as a MAN such as country/continent etc. WAN is expensive and should or might not be owned by one organization. ***PSTN*** or ***satellite*** medium is used for wide area networks
       
       4. **PAN** (personal area network). It's a network covering a very small area, usually a small room. The best known wireless PAN network technology is **luetooth**, and the most popular wired PAN is **USB**.

2. Networks reference models
   1. OSI Model **(Open Systems Interconnection Model)**
       *  Overview
          * Transmit data between 2 Hosts, contain a total of 7 layers
